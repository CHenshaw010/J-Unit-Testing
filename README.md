### Personal Notes:
- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - There are many techniques necessary to ensure software is functional and secure. It it highly important to review the requirements prior to development so any new development will be tailored to meet the requirements. Next, the code should constantly be compiled and run to ensure no new errors have been introduced or can be addressed early. Reviews of the code should also be conducted to ensure no weaknesses in code syntax exist. Finally, unit testing is paramount to ensure the code is functional. In doing so, the unit tests can be created off the specifications of the requirements. Therefore, if any test fails, the code base does not meet that requirement.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - Communication is key in interpreting user needs. The customer should be available to address any concerns or questions about how to proceed ensuring the software continually meets requirements and gray areas are eliminated. In doing so, the customer will lay out requirements the software must meet, both functional and non-functional. These requirements should be verified by the customer, documented so they can be reviewed, and checked against the codebase at a later date. This processes will ensure the customer's needs have been met and the code functions as intended.

- How do I approach designing software?
  - I approach designing software with a methodical approach. First, the requirements must be elicited. From there, any questions can be addressed and any additional information necessary can be obtained. Next, the software can be designed by identifying what will be necessary to meet the requirements. After thorough designing has been done, the code can be written tailored to the requirements. The code should also be frequently compiled and ran ensuring no errors have been introduced. After a unit has been written, it should be examined through unit tests with predefined inputs so the output can also be predetermined. If the output of the code does not match the expected output, the unit should be examined for the reason. These unit test will be written to the specifications of the requirements which means a passed test is a section of code that fulfills the requirements. Once units are integrated, similar integration testing should be conducted ensuring each module can communicate effective. In this whole process, secure coding practices should be utilized to protect data wherever possible. Furthermore, coding standards should be upheld which will enhance the readability and maintainability of the software.
